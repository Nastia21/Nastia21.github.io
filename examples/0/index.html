<p>The main difference between vertebrates and invertebrates is the presence of a cartilaginous or bony skeleton.

The main representatives of the class of vertebrates are mammals, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles. 
The ancestors of vertebrates, according to scientists, resemble modern lancelets.</p>
